							<h1>Phe’s House</h1>
							<p class="major">Welcome to Phil Barron’s House — known personally by the current owner and her family as “Phe’s House” — a coal miner’s thatched cottage situated in the picturesque village of Clogh, just outside of the coal mining town of Castlecomer, Kilkenny, Ireland. Just 19km away is Kilkenny’s historical city which hosts annual tourists from all over the world flocking to see its medieval streets as well as the famous Kilkenny Castle.</p>
							<p class="major">However, the years have not been kind to this little old house, and so, we are seeking funding to restore this piece of Irish history back to its former beauty. To help with this project, we have launched a GoFundMe page for the costs of renovating the house.</p>
							<p class="major">Although Phil Barron’s House is a protected building under Ireland’s National Inventory of Architectural Heritage (Reg No: 12400203), it remains the owner’s responsibility to upkeep the maintenance of the house. </p>

							<h2>Current State</h2>
							<p>This little old lady was last thatched and repaired with great effort by the owner, Helen Kealy-Dunne and her husband, Ambrose Dunne in 2004, in which the condition of the cottage was perhaps the best it has ever been. However, due to Helen’s ill health, the cottage has fallen into disrepair since thatched cottages are one of the most demanding architectural buildings to maintain in comparison to a tiled roof. Thatched cottages deteriorate fast if not regularly kept, especially in Ireland’s damp climate.</p>
							<p>Several areas of the roof have currently caved in and the wood has started to rot as a result of harsh weather conditions. The interior is also being spoilt by leaks and staining from the roof. The thatch on the roof has deteriorated badly to the point where only tarpaulins are keeping the weather out — highlighting the roof’s urgent need for replacement. Internally, the roof timbers are cracking and the roof is in danger of collapse. The proposed works will save the house by replacing the old thatch on the roof, making it weatherproof for years to come.</p>
							<p>This house is a time machine into Ireland’s coal mining heritage, and its upkeep is of cultural, historical, and sentimental importance not only to the family but to the Clogh community, Irish natives, and visitors from abroad. This cottage preserves the evidence of a way of life that has disappeared from modern Irish society. It is a simple, vernacular dwelling that could once be found the length and breadth of Ireland.</p>

							<h2>What We Need</h2>
							<p>We are relying on the generosity of others with donations to fund the restoration of this iconic thatched house — one of Europe’s oldest coal mining cottages still standing today — since the maintenance of a thatched roof is generally the most costly of roofing jobs.</p>
							<p>In order to revive this old lady, we have launched a GoFundMe page with a goal of €25,000. The owner is eager to save the house as it is of great significance to the whole family.</p>

							<h2>Our Plan</h2>
							<p>The plan for this restoration project is to strip the weathered layer of thatch and re-thatch the roof with Irish oaten straw —  thatching material made from the stems and leaves of the oat straw which are harvested early while the grass is still green. As well as this, we aim to carry out repairs to the underlying timber structure as necessary.</p>
							<p>Traditional craft skills will be utilised when carrying out the appropriate handiwork for this cottage in order to not modernise the building in any way. </p>
							<p>The overall goal will be the faithful repair or replacement of what exists or did exist while maintaining good conservation practice. The cottage will be repaired with the materials that reflect the original materials of the house where at all possible. </p>
							<p>We will also whitewash the interior and exterior walls which is the process of covering a wall with a very thin coat of plaster made with water, lime, and other ingredients such as horsehair which are used to bind the mix together. These original materials as well as the process in which it’s done will complement the original qualities and aesthetics of the house. Thatched cottages with whitewashed walls are an iconic symbol of traditional Ireland that date back to old crannóg (young tree), one-roomed cottages that housed labourers and their families. </p>
							<p>Finally, the iconic red half-door which has been a key feature of the house for anyone driving past, as well as a tradition carried out by the owning family, will be repainted with a fresh, new coat.</p>
							<p>Ultimately, the owner, Helen, and her family would like to return this old lady to her former beauty, adding more character to the already charismatic village of Clogh in which the house is located. </p>

							<h2>The House</h2>
							<p>“Phe’s House” gets its name from the late owner, Philip Barron (1911-2001). When the current owner, Helen Kealy-Dunne, was just a child, she couldn’t pronounce her grand-uncle’s name. So, “Philip” became “Phe” and his descendants still refer to their beloved uncle and his house as “Phe’s.” </p>
							<p>To locals in the area, the charming thatched cottage on the bridge with the iconic red half-door is known as “Phil’s Barron’s House.” Helen and her children even spent two months living in the two-roomed cottage back in 2010 — reenacting the simplistic yet challenging lifestyle of their ancestors. </p>

							<h2>The History of the House</h2>
							<p>The owner of the house, Helen, and her family can trace their ancestors and previous owners of the cottage back more than 160 years. Originally the house had only one room, but at some point, a partition wall was erected to make two separate rooms. There was also no bathroom in the cottage which is still a feature of the house today. </p>

							<h2>Who Lived Here?</h2>
							<p>In the mid-1800s, John Delaney and his wife lived in the small cottage where their eight daughters were born. However, it’s not clear where all eight women eventually ended up. Some may have left Ireland, some may have stayed, but one of the daughters, Ann, became Helen’s great-grandmother. </p>
							<p>Memories passed down through the family recall John Delaney waiting at the large open turf fire in the kitchen for his baby to be born. Upon the arrival of his eighth daughter, the midwife told John, “You have another little washerwoman,” to which John replied, “And she is as welcomed as the first.”</p>
							<p>It’s understood that the cottage became isolated though at some point when the eight girls grew up, perhaps after their parents passed away. However, one of the eight daughters, Ann, and her husband, Thomas (Tom) Barron (married in November 1903) would eventually reclaim the family home and make it their own. </p>
							<p>Tom Barron, originally from Chatsworth in Clogh, was a local farm-hand getting work wherever he could in the surrounding areas of County Kilkenny and Laois and living in several neighbouring areas with his wife and children. But one day, rather than occupy another rented house, Tom kicked in the door of his wife’s idle family home, lit the fire, and raised their five children, Margaret (Maggie), Ann (Nan), Kate (Katie), Philip (Phe), and John in this cosy two-roomed house. </p>

							<h2>The Unique Characteristics of the House</h2>
							<p>The house and its adjoining garden that sit beneath Clogh bridge, next to Clogh River, still remain in the family today. In the house, there still survives a handmade wooden settle bed that Tom made from an ash tree in the garden and was built on the kitchen floor of the cottage. It has never left the house since. The handcrafted settle bed was used as a bench to sit on but was also pulled out as a sleeping cot in which all Tom and Ann’s children slept in, using straw for bedding. This multi-functional settle bed is a typical design of the original, vernacular furniture that existed during this time in Ireland. </p>
							<p>The family member’s of the house were also waked in the settle bed before their funerals, including Tom Barron himself who died in 1956, and his wife, Ann who died in 1947. This authentic settle bed is a cherished component of the house and has never left the front door since Tom built it on the kitchen floor that day. </p>
